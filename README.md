## Site Summary and Deployment Plan

This has without a doubt been my most challenging project yet- adding Javascript to my language vocabulary has been
an uphill struggle at points. But once I broke out of Imposter Syndrome mentality, This has without a doubt become my 
most enjoyable project creation yet.

Due to my history working within the Hospitality sector, I naturally gravitate towards creating websites within that
sector because I guess it's become a comfort zone area for me. At first I had decided to create a restaurant/cafe 
website for my employers- and I did! Got to a point of completion- and decided it wasn't enough, it didn't fit with
what I wanted to create for my assessment criteria. So I went back to the drawing board and debated what was pheasable
and what kind of API's I wanted to use. I was actually surfing a facebook group I'm apart of when the idea for 'Discover
Penwith' dawned on me. 

Cornwall has become one of the most popular tourist destinations in the UK, even more so since Staycationing became the
new trend after the Pandemic crisis. Pondering this I decided there wasn't a specific enough guide on Penwith, my area of
Cornwall. For those that don't know what Penwith is- there's two answers! To the English, it's a district of the county
of Cornwall. To the Cornish, it's a county of the forgotten nation of Cornwall. There is simply so much to see and do here, I decided to make a guide to give people ideas of places to visit, things to
do and awesome places to eat. And so, the Discover Penwith site is born.  

To start with it will be a guide, offering links and ideas as an initial MVP site. But long term, I want it to embrace
the local community and become a space for people to interact over local events, suggest things or places to add to the
site content, and help grow the local economy back from the Pandemic and Brexit crisis.

- **Typography:**  
The site has uses Google Fonts to style the Typorgraphy. The main font used is Open Sans Condensed, with Lato and
Caveat used as secondary fonts.


- **Colour Scheme:**

being black and white- reflecting the flag. And then a sandy/yellow colour for hover effects/links to add a 
distinctive finish to the site.

- **Images:**  
All the images used on the site are either taken by myself, my partner or our local community facebook group with
the permission of the owners for use in this project. There are a lot of images being used on this because when it 
comes to travel a picture really does "speak a thousand words".
