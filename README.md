## Site Summary and Development Plan

This has without a doubt been my most challenging project yet- adding Javascript to my language vocabulary has been
an uphill struggle at points. But once I broke out of Imposter Syndrome mentality, This has without a doubt become my 
most enjoyable project creation yet.

Due to my history working within the Hospitality sector, I naturally gravitate towards creating websites within that
sector because I guess it's become a comfort zone area for me. At first I had decided to create a restaurant/cafe 
website for my employers- and I did! Got to a point of completion- and decided it wasn't enough, it didn't fit with
what I wanted to create for my assessment criteria. So I went back to the drawing board and debated what was pheasable
and what kind of API's I wanted to use. I was actually surfing a facebook group I'm apart of when the idea for 'Discover
Penwith' dawned on me. 

Cornwall has become one of the most popular tourist destinations in the UK, even more so since Staycationing became the
new trend after the Pandemic crisis. Pondering this I decided there wasn't a specific enough guide on Penwith, my area of
Cornwall. For those that don't know what Penwith is- there's two answers! To the English, it's a district of the county
of Cornwall. To the Cornish, it's a county of the forgotten nation of Cornwall. There is simply so much to see and do here, I decided to make a guide to give people ideas of places to visit, things to
do and awesome places to eat. And so, the Discover Penwith site is born.  

To start with it will be a guide, offering links and ideas as an initial MVP site. But long term, I want it to embrace
the local community and become a space for people to interact over local events, suggest things or places to add to the
site content, and help grow the local economy back from the Pandemic and Brexit crisis.

# User Experience (UX)

## User Experience Stories

- First Time User Goals:  
  - a. As a First Time User, I want to be able to easily navigate the site.
  - b. As a First Time User, I want to have access to information on destinations without being drowned in information 
  that I'm not looking for.
  - c. As a First Time User, I want tips or ideas on different places to visit whilst visiting Cornwall.

- Frequent User Goals:  
  - a. As a Frequent User, I want to be able to access the sites Social Media to see if there is any extra 
  information or news available on those channels.
  - b. As a Frequent User, I want to be able to easily navigate to external sources of supporting information.

- Returning User Goals:  
  - a. As a Returning User, I want to be able to get involved with making suggestions for places to visit and
  extra site content.
  

## Design  

- **Typography:**  
The site uses Google Fonts to style the Typorgraphy. The main font used is Open Sans Condensed, with Lato and
Caveat used as secondary fonts. 

- **Logo:**  
The logo is a simple text based one created within the Internet Development Environment using the Google Font Caveat and the
CSS text shadowing effect using the same colours from the websites designated Colour Scheme.


- **Colour Scheme:**  
For the colour scheme I decided to use the colours of the Cornish Flag and the ceromonial colours. The main colours
being black and white- reflecting the flag. And then a sandy/yellow colour for hover effects/links to add a 
distinctive finish to the site.

- **Images:**  
All the images used on the site are either taken by myself, my partner or our local community facebook group with
the permission of the owners for use in this project. There are a lot of images being used on this because when it 
comes to travel a picture really does "speak a thousand words".

- **Site Appearance:**
There is a clear and crisp repetition of colours and structured layout throughout the site so that Users are quickly and 
intuitively used to the sites design.

## Wireframes  

I decided to sketch my wireframes by hand because I'm much more confident with designing them this way- and in all honesty it gives
my eyes some extra screen free time to recover and recoup slightly. You can find links to my original wireframes below:

- **The Discover Penwith Desktop Wireframes:**
[PDF of Desktop Wireframes](/pdf/discover-penwith-wireframes.pdf)  

  Please see the attached PDF for a written summary of the desktop wireframes for this project along with images of the original
  sketches.  

- **The Mobile Wireframe:** 
[PDF of Mobile Wireframe](/pdf/mobile-wireframe.pdf)

  Please see the attached PDF for a written summary and image of the sketched wireframe.  

## Site Evolution Since Wireframe Sketches

Throughout the design process some ideas and factors of the website have changed, for clarity I have decided to write an evaluation 
of the changes made to each page here. Some aspects of the site such as the Navigation and Footer are available across all pages, and 
are identical in style and functionality. 

- **The Discover Page:**

- **The Explore Page:**

- **The Join In Page:**

# Technologies Used 

## Languages Used:
- [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5)  
- [CSS3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)  
- [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/)

## Frameworks, Libraries and Programs Used:

1. [Bootstrap 4.5.2](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/):
    - Bootstrap was used to speedily build the layout of the website and to optimise the responsiveness of the
    website across all devices.  

2. [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/):  
   - The Google Fonts CDN is used to import styled typography to the site using the Open Sans Condensed, Lato and the
   Caveat fonts.

3. [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/):
    - Font Awesome is used to add icons to some of the links used on the site to make them stand out more to users.

4. [Git](https://git-scm.com/):
    - Git is used for version control of the website.

5. [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/):
    - Gitpod was used as the Internet Development Environment for the final draft of the website.

6. [repl.it](https://repl.it/):
    - Repl.it was used during the draft stages of the site creation as it's completely free to use which makes it
    brilliant to use when playing around with different ideas still.

7. [Github](https://github.com/):
    - Github is used to store the committed repositories from Git/Gitpod.  

8. [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/):
    - Google Chrome was used throughout the Development period, with the Google Chrome Dev Tools 
    environment being crucial to assessing things that need fixing or changing before taking action.

9. [EZGIF.com](https://ezgif.com/):
    - ezgif.com has been used to convert some of the featured images from JPG to WEBP format so that they load faster, 
    and the browser processes the website faster with smaller file sizes to load.  

10. [Minify Code](http://minifycode.com/):  
    - Minify Code has been used to minify the CSS file for optimised website loading, and also to beautify the HTML, CSS 
    and Javascript code so that it's easier to read through.

11. [Am I Responsive?](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/):  
     - Used to provide the screenshot of Discover Penwith across multiple devices at the top of this README.md file.

12. [Responsinator](http://www.responsinator.com/): 
     - Used to check how responsive the site is across multiple device types.  

13. [jQuery](https://jquery.com/):  
     - jQuery is used to speed up the process of writing Javascript code, by offering a much simpler syntax enabling
     the user to write Javascript based code much faster. A large part of the core functionality of the site comes
     from utilising jQuery. The Town Information sections are fully operated using jQuery code. 

14. [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/):    
     - Facebook has been used to supply the images across this site, the majority from my personal profile and others
     have been sourced from the local facebook group I participate in with consent from the owners.

15. [FormsApp](https://surveyheart.com/form/606849767b70be36e2f9fc54#welcome):
    - I decided to build in an ongoing survey for users to contribute their User Experience Stories to be used for future
    reviews and possible changes to the site based on the suggestions made.

16. [Monzo Payment Links](https://monzo.me/jakelashbrook6):
    - I also decided to add a donation button to the #SUPPORT section because I was intrigued with the monzo payment link technology.
    This is an area I will likely build on in the future development of the app by incorporating Stripe and/or Paypal into the design.
17. [EmailJS API](https://www.emailjs.com/):
    - The EmailJS API is used to power the #JOIN IN form so that a specific email address can receive what's input by the website form 
    users.
18. [Google Maps/Places API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview):
    - The Google Maps/Places API was used to create a map with chosen markers, information and a street view of each selected
    location.

## Testing User Stories from the UX Section 

- First Time User Goals:  
  - a. As a First Time User, I want to be able to easily navigate the site.
    - When you enter the site, there are clear navigation options across all page.
    - Every page of the site features 'Call To Action' buttons that easily navigate to other areas of the site.
    - Every page features a 'back to the top' button that appears when the page has been scrolled through.
    - The discover page features information areas you can open easily for each town. Each area has a close button floating
    at the top-right side of the page.
  - b. As a First Time User, I want to have access to information on destinations without being drowned in information 
  that I'm not looking for.
    - The town areas are contained within areas that can be easily opened or closed with clear UX friendly buttons.
    - There is a slideshow of destinations to visit on the homepage with easy usability and links for more information.
  - c. As a First Time User, I want tips or ideas on different places to visit whilst visiting Cornwall.
    - There is the slideshow mentioned above with easy suggestions for days out.
    - The #EXPLORE map contains 36 different destinations to visit for users, with links and information available for the selected
    destinations.

- Frequent User Goals:  
  - a. As a Frequent User, I want to be able to access the sites Social Media to see if there is any extra 
  information or news available on those channels.
    - The Social Media Links are available throughout the site within the footer area.
  - b. As a Frequent User, I want to be able to easily navigate to external sources of supporting information.
    - All relevant external resources are linked within the appropriate sections. There are links to the selected 
    locations websites (where applicable) within their generated info links. 
    - There are also links available for transport information to external websites within the selected towns information areas
    on the homepage.
    - All links are targeted as blank to open new windows for users.
- Returning User Goals:  
  - a. As a Returning User, I want to be able to get involved with making suggestions for places to visit and
  extra site content.
    - I've tried to add in multiple ways for users to get involved with the website by creating a whole page # JOIN IN 
    dedicated to fulfulling user engagement with Discover Penwith.
    - The # JOIN IN form prompts users to send a message if they want any destinations adding to the site, any new content or 
    would like to get involved in some other way.
    - The #FEEDBACK section within the #JOIN IN page is especially dedicated to surverying users on their User Experience. This is 
    an ongoing survey taken via an external link with a 3rd party (See Frameworks Credited) organisation. The survey data will be 
    used when analysing future releases and upgrades to the site.
    - The #SUPPORT section is aimed at getting users involved with the long term growth of the site by giving them insight into some 
    of the future design plans. It also enables users to donate to the upkeep and enhancement of the site by offering a payment link 
    powered by Monzo (also listed as a Framework credit).

## UX Survey 

Like my previous project, I decided to incorporate extra facilities for User Experience Testing by using the surveyheart 
app on my # JOIN IN page. Users simply have to click on the button, a new window will open with the survey and users can
leave their thoughts and opinions. The ongoing survey results will be analysed and used for building future enhancements 
and releases of the app after the initial MVP release. 

If you would like to contribute to the UX Survey, you can [click here](https://surveyheart.com/form/606849767b70be36e2f9fc54#welcome).

I plan to add suggested updates from the Survey before each new release of Discover Penwith.

Upon completing the survey users can see a summary of all the questions that have been asked so far, This summary will be 
evaluated before each new release planning starts. Please [take the survey](https://surveyheart.com/form/606849767b70be36e2f9fc54#welcome) if you would like to see an analysis of the results
so far.

## Manual Testing During Initial Deployment Stages

To be safe and know for sure my MVP website is ready for an initial release and go to submission for my course with Code Institute, 
I decided to make a log of the processes of manual testing undertaken after the initial deployment in order to assess whether it's 
at an acceptable level to release as an MVP and submit. To begin with, I've started testing on mobile and laptop manually whether all of 
the links, buttons, and images are doing what they're supposed to be. On initial checking- they're all responding how I expected them too.  

**Discover Page Testing:**
1. All links on page checked to make sure that they're functioning correctly. 
2. Check page validation again in at [W3 HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fjakelashbrook.github.io%2Fdiscover-penwith%2Findex.html) 
for the 'Discover' homepage.
 - i. Warning given about using the type attribute on the Javascript resource link to the main.js file. 
    - Issue Fix - removed the type attribute from the index.html page. [Issue Fixed](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fjakelashbrook.github.io%2Fdiscover-penwith%2Findex.html).
 - ii. Error listed for the function saying 'Attribute function not allowed at this point of the a element'. 
    - Issue Fix - First attempt, moving the function call to the start of the attribute list. This makes no difference whatsoever, so then 
    I tired to change the function attribute to the onclick attribute. This [fixed the issue](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fjakelashbrook.github.io%2Fdiscover-penwith%2Findex.html).
3. Checked to see all images are loaded correctly.
4. Checked all buttons are functioning correctly.
5. HTML sections need to be distinguished for SEO.

**Explore Page Testing:** 
1. All links on the #EXPLORE page have been tested and are working. 
2. The map has been tested and is working but with 2 slight glitches:
 - i. The map doesn't automatically load until one of the buttons that generates the different markers on the map is clicked.
 - ii. The info windows generate on the map as expected, however when a new info-window is clicked the previous one does not close
 as was expected. This is a problem within the codebase that needs to be carefully fixed to enhance the overall User Experience.
3. As expected, the Street View of each marker selected is generated upon a new marker being clicked. There are no problems with 
this feature. However, I plan to keep an eye on the street view locations to see if they can be updated if/when Google updates the 
locations which offer a Street View.
4. All images displayed correctly.
5. The last thing that caught my attention was that when the # TOUR section appears with the Street View the section blends with the 
footer, this can be resolved with a simple white border-top being added to the footer element. 
6. HTML Sections need to be distinguished for SEO.

**Join In Page Testing:**
1. All links work correctly.
2. The form functions correctly. 
3. All Images display correctly on the page and the info-windows.
4. All buttons function correctly. 
5. HTML Section need to be distinguished for SEO.

** Overall Site Testing:**
