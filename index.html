<div id="st-ives-info" class="container-fluid text-center d-none">
	<p>St Ives is a town in Cornwall, UK, known for its surf beaches, like Porthmeor, and its art scene. The seafront Tate St Ives gallery has rotating modern art exhibitions, focusing on British artists. Nearby, the Barbara Hepworth Museum and Sculpture Garden, in the modernist artist’s former studio, displays her bronzes and other works. Boat trips go to Seal Island, just west of town, to see the seal colony. Strolling along the harbour in the summertime you'll be inundated with oppurtunities to take different boat trips and find multiple different pasty shops to sample the most famous Cornish cuisine.</p>
	<p>St. Ives is arguably one of the most famous Staycation resorts in the UK, and seems to grow more popular every year. With it's picturesque views of a variety of beaches to suit all occasions, old Cornish cobbled streets with quaint shops, museums, galleries and a huge selection of bars and restaurants there's something for everybody. St Ives (Cornish: Porth Ia, meaning "St Ia’s cove") is a seaside town, civil parish and port in Cornwall, England. The town lies north of Penzance and west of Camborne on the coast of the Celtic Sea. In former times it was commercially dependent on fishing. The decline in fishing, however, caused a shift in commercial emphasis, and the town is now primarily a popular seaside resort, notably achieving the title of Best UK Seaside Town from the British Travel Awards in both 2010 and 2011. St Ives was incorporated by Royal Charter in 1639. St Ives has become renowned for its number of artists. It was named best seaside town of 2007 by The Guardian newspaper. It should not be confused with St Ive, a village and civil parish in south-east Cornwall.</p>
	<h3 class="pt-3">The Development of Tourism</h3>
	<p>The modern seaside resort developed as a result of the arrival of the St Ives Bay branch line from St Erth, part of the Great Western Railway in 1877. With it came a new generation of Victorian seaside holidaymakers. Much of the town was built during the latter part of the 19th century. The railway, which winds along the cliffs and bays, survived the Beeching cuts and has become a tourist attraction itself. In 1952, the Royal Navy warship HMS Wave ran aground near the town. The ship was later salvaged, repaired and returned to service. A propeller believed to be from HMS Wave was washed ashore in 2008. In 1999, the town was the first landfall of the solar eclipse of 11 August 1999. The Tate St Ives displayed an exhibition called As Dark as Light, with art by Yuko Shiraishi, Garry Fabian Miller and local schoolchildren, to celebrate the event. A live BBC programme with the astronomer Patrick Moore was clouded out and the eclipse was missed.</p>

	<br>
	<h3 class="pt-3">Art in St Ives</h3>
	<p>Bernard Leach and Shōji Hamada set up the Leach Pottery in 1920. Leach who, was a studio potter and art teacher and is known as the "Father of British studio pottery", learned pottery under the direction of Shigekichi Urano (Kenzan VI) in Japan where he also met Shōji Hamada. They promoted pottery from the point of view of Western and Eastern arts and philosophies. Leach produced work until 1972, and the Victoria and Albert Museum held an exhibition of his work in 1977. The Leach Pottery remains operational and houses a small museum showcasing work by Leach and his students. In 1928, the Cornish artist Alfred Wallis and Ben Nicholson and Christopher Wood met at St Ives and laid the foundation for the artists' colony there. In 1939, Ben Nicholson, Barbara Hepworth and Naum Gabo settled in St Ives, attracted by its beauty. In 1993, a branch of the Tate Gallery, the Tate St Ives, opened. The Tate has also owned the Barbara Hepworth Museum and her sculpture garden since 1980. The town attracted artists from overseas such as Piet Mondrian, and Maurice Sumray who moved from London in 1968, and continues to do so today with younger artists such as Michael Polat, who took up residence there from his native Germany in 1999. Before the 1940s, most artists in St Ives and West Cornwall belonged to the St Ives Society of Artists; but events in the late 1940s led to a dispute between the abstract and figurative artists in the group. In 1948 the abstract faction broke away to form the Penwith Society of Artists led by Barbara Hepworth and Ben Nicholson.</p>
	<p>In 1962 Frederick Spratt took a sabbatical in Britain for one year, where he lived and painted representationally in St Ives. The studio pottery Troika was set up in 1963. A 2010, a BBC Four film, The Art of Cornwall, presented by James Fox said that the St Ives artists "went on to produce some of the most exhilarating art of the twentieth century...for a few dazzling years this place was as famous as Paris, as exciting as New York and infinitely more progressive than London." The programme explored the lives and works of the key figures and their contributions in establishing St Ives as a major centre of British art from the 1920s onwards.</p>

	<h3 class="pt-3">Transport in St Ives</h3>
	<p>St Ives railway station is linked to the Paddington to Penzance main rail route via the St Ives branch line which runs frequent services from St Erth. The line was opened in 1877 by the St Ives branch railway, but became part of the Great Western Railway in 1878. Before 2019, the park & ride facility for visitors to St Ives ran from Lelant Saltings railway station. The station had been opened on 27 May 1978 specifically for this purpose. After development works at St Erth station in 2019 to improve transport links, the park and ride was moved there.</p>
	<p>The branchline also links the St Ives to nearby Carbis Bay and Lelant. The town also has regular services by National Express coaches from London Victoria Coach Station, Heathrow and other places in Britain. First Kernow buses also connect St Ives to nearby towns and villages, such as Zennor, Penzance and Truro. The nearest airports to St Ives are Newquay and Land's End Airport, near St Just. Private jets, charters and helicopters are served by Perranporth Airfield.</p>

	<p>Hayle is the up and coming destination boasting 3 miles of golden sands stretching from a picturesque harbour in development to the rocky surf beach overlooking a lighthouse with fantastic views towards St. Ives and easy access to the A30, it makes a great base town to explore west Cornwall from. Hayle's position by the sea and its 3 miles of golden sandy beaches allowed it to develop as a holiday destination. Indeed, Hayle still has much holiday accommodation. The sand dunes or Towans are the favoured location for a number of holiday villages and caravan and camping sites. The Gwithian beach near Godrevy is picturesque and a popular area for water-related sports including surfing, windsurfing and body-boarding.</p>
	<h3 class="pt-3">The Harbour Regeneration</h3>
	<p>Since the 1980s, Hayle Harbour has been the focus of several projects and schemes aimed at regenerating the local economy of Penwith. In the 1980s, well-known businessman Peter de Savary fronted an attempt to develop the harbour area but ultimately failed to attract financial support to bring his plans to fruition. Despite several other similar schemes, today the harbour is still not regenerated. In 2004, ING Real Estate, an international property development company, became the owners of Hayle harbour [1] and started to purchase land within the immediate vicinity of their planned project area. In April 2008, ING submitted an outline planning application to the planning department of Penwith District Council. As of November 2009, the granting of outline planning permission still depends on the Section 106 Agreement being agreed, a sticking point to this is finalising traffic and transport improvements.</p>

	<h3 class="pt-3">World Heritage Site</h3>
	<p>Outside of the harbour area, Hayle has been the site of a number of successful regeneration schemes; including the ongoing Harveys Foundry project which has seen the development of business and residential units in the hope of attracting employment to the Hayle area; and projects being progressed through the Hayle Area Plan include retail developments. Asda opened a large superstore in Hayle in 2015. The design of the building had to fit in to its local surroundings because it is situated in an area which is part of a UNESCO world heritage site. A new petrol station plan for the store was submitted in 2017. Bars and restaurants are also planned as part of the ongoing regeneration of the area.</p>

	<p>The townscape of Hayle and its historic harbour were part of the initial submission of the Cornwall and West Devon historic mining landscape World Heritage bid. On 13 July 2006 it was announced that the bid had been successful and that the historic mining landscape of Cornwall and West Devon would be added to World Heritage list.</p>
	<h3 class="pt-3">Hayle in Bloom and King George V Memorial Walk</h3>
	<p>The Hayle community has a long and proud history of partaking in the 'In Bloom' competition, with special emphasis given to the King George V Memorial Walk all year round. The walk is a personal favourite of many locals who go along to relax or walk their dogs whilst taking in the views of all the plants and the Copperhouse Pool. This Walk stretches the vast majority of central Hayle, and you can view the town from across the pool.</p>

	<h3 class="pt-3">Transport in Hayle</h3>
	<p>Hayle railway station is close to Foundry Square, at the east end of the viaduct. It is also linked to the harbour area along a footpath that used to be the branch railway line serving the quays. It is served by Great Western Railway and CrossCountry with local services to Plymouth and services to destinations including London Paddington, Manchester Piccadilly and beyond. National Express run three daily services from Hayle stopping at Foundry Square and Copperhouse</p>
